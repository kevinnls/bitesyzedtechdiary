A while back (read four months ago), I had suggested that a friend learn Python using a particular book.
But before that, I wanted them to know <q>some things that are usually not covered
in courses and books.</q>

Now I'm going to try and put as much of that (and some more) in a blog post as quickly as I can.

# GUI vs CUI

Most users of computers interact with their devices through a graphical interface &ndash; a GUI &ndash;
that has a variety of visual cues. A close button on the top corner, an icon for the help menu, a button
to confirm that you ~~are selling your personal information to BigData~~ accept the terms of that agreement
you definitely read. All these familar ways to interact often by pointing and clicking/tapping.

There is also another way to interact with a computer&mdash;by typing out commands.

Let's take a simple example of things to do

1. Go to the Desktop
2. Create a new folder called "hello_cui"
3. Create a file named after you
4. Delete a file
5. Rename a file
6. Open a file in notepad
7. View contents of a file using the CUI.
