### Redmi 9 Power

I use a [Redmi 9 Power](https://www.mi.com/in/redmi-9-power/specs/) 4GB+64GB
([on GSM Arena](https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_9_power-10616.php)).

It has been my main phone for about a year and a quarter now.

At the time I bought it, these were my main considerations

- cheap cheap cheap
- side mounted or in-screen fingerprint sensor
- big battery
- expandable storage

### MIUI do I?

I did have my hesitations. I wasn't a fan of MIUI on the basis of my
third-party-shoulder-browsing interactions with it.

But I told myself

> So many people use it, it can't be that bad, right?

And it wasn't that bad. It wasn't without hitches: but they were minor.
Especially in the ringtone/notification settings.

The gesture navigation was amazing. And having floating windows was
wonderful. It was useful when I had to refer to something in another app
but could not copy from there.

I think it may also have to do with the _flavour_ of MIUI my device
has. It says **MIUI Global**, whatever that is.

### MIUI 12.5 finally got I!

For a long time I was stuck on an older version of MIUI. I had heard 12.5
was supposed to be good and was hoping for it. But now I don't even recall
why I had wanted 12.5.
