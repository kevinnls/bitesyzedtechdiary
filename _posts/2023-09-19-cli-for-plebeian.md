The terminal is oft considered an esoteric tool intended
for programmers and none else. The sight of a terminal is
immediately associated with coding.

Okay, most would immediately disqualify my being "plebeian"
on account of my using vimâ€¦ doesn't help that I was writing
in markdown.

But this post is more about the terminal being useful in fields
other than programming. In this particular case, a university
literature course.

## The splitting task

The instructor was going to go over excerpts from course material.
Some of the material was really long pdf files. But we only
needed a few sections. How do we extract out only the parts we need?

We could <abbr title="sign an eternal contract in money">pay
Adobe</abbr> to let us extract pages. Or my sneaky trick
of opening the pdf file in a browser and printing to file
after typing in the range of pages I need. But repeating
that 12 times with different page ranges each time is
meh.

## The CLI can split and unite

On the terminal, I have access to a tool called `pdfseparate`
that extracts pages from a pdf. But each page is saved to its
own file. Luckily, there's also a `pdfunite` that does I could
use to combine these files.

But while that solves the question of tools to use, I do still
need to repeatedly specify the page numbers somewhat like

```shell
pdfseparate -f 4 -l 5 "filename.pdf" "filename-p%d.pdf"
pdfunite "filename-p4.pdf" "filename-p5.pdf" "filename.excerpt.pdf"
```

That is two separate commands for just one file and each
filename and page count needs to be stated so expresslyâ€¦ how is this more
efficient?

It isn't. But the command line offers so much opportunity
for efficiency through other features such as loops.

## Loops

I could simply change my command to go over all the pdf files and
run the commands for each one. By using a variable `${file}`, I
can let the terminal (technically shell) change the filename
for each command.

```shell
for file in *.pdf; do
    pdfseparate -f XYZ -l XYZ "${file}.pdf" "${file}-p%d.page" ;
    pdfunite "${file}-p*.page" "${file}.excerpt.pdf" ;
done
```

Additionally, I set the individual pages to be saved to `.page` files
instead of `.pdf` file. This lets me use the `${file}-p*.page` part
to indicate a pattern of filenames instead of specifying each file
that needs to be combined by `pdfunite`; and also won't interfere
with my loop that is looking for the pattern `*.pdf`.

### Wildcards / Globs
The `*` is called a glob character (or wildcard) to mean that it
can match anything. In this particular case, it is being used
to select all files whose names match a particular pattern.

## Varying page numbers

Yet persists the problem of the required page number ranges
being different for each pdf file. I could use variables again.
But for this one, a little bit of manual typing is needed. So
I created a spreadsheet and ~~pushed off~~ delegated to a
classmate, the work of keying in the first and last page
number for each filename.

Spreadsheets can be easily exported to CSV (comma-separated value)
files. Then, I used a different loop on the CSV file's rows instead
of working on `*.pdf` as I did before.

```csv
filename-093.pdf,5,45
fileplace-02.pdf,3,12
fileanima-98.pdf,9,11
filethgns-09.pdf,1,9
```
The above is a sample CSV file. Now I could get values for three variables
from each row of the file, the filename, first page and last page.

```shell
while IFS=, read file firstp lastp; do
    pdfseparate -f ${firstp} -l ${lastp} "${file}.pdf" "${file}-p%d.page" ;
    pdfunite "${file}-p*.page" "${file}.excerpt.pdf" ;
done
```
You could also go further and combine all the excerpts into a single big file
using the handy `*.excerpt.pdf` pattern.

```shell
pdfunite "*.exercpt.pdf" "allmaterial.pdf"
```

## CLI for mooore than just code

And with that I conclude this badly written blog post. The CLI is useful in
situations other than coding&mdash;such as a university literature course.

Or to simple take notes in class if you use vim ðŸ˜Ž
