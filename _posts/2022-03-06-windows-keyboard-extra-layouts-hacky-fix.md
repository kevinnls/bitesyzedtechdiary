### Windows showed extra keyboard layouts

[A while back]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2022-02-19-return-from-vacay %}#windows-and-keyboards)
I noticed that Windows had additional keyboard layouts in the language
switching menu even though they were not enabled in the settings.

### A hacky fix

How do you fix it? I'm sure there was some registry that I could have
meddled with. But for today, I did a simpler hack. I added the
language/layout combo that was in excess and removed it. Tada!
