### A very smart idea

To help focus on discovering and learning tech, blog aboug it!

How very original.

### Implementing said idea

Of course I was going to use [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com)!

I love Jekyll. But my problems always arise from trying to combine Jekyll
with [GitHub Pages](//pages.github.com).

And I had to Dockerise the local development environment!
I am not a _barbarian_. Just a bit bound to overengineer.

Anyway, I had reference material from
[doing this once before](https://github.com/notknowofdoing/cheatsheets/commit/6475d644de23b6ae38758799722ac0040872bfb4)
after all, right?

### Docker for Dev; Dev for Docker

I was wrong.

> Past experience proved paltry assistance

I tried copying exactly as is, but still could not get the local server
to render styles.

The previous project was created using `jekyll new .` -- something I
decided not to do this time.

So now I am stuck with an unstyled blog in local, and a styled one on the
web. I could have just started writing the blog, because the content
is what matters more; but no. I am leaving this stuck for today.
