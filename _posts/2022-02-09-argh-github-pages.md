### Broken links

Testing out my site a long time after deploying it, I noticed there are
broken links. The links worked perfectly in my local setup, even after
setting `baseurl` and testing things.
But lovely GitHub Pages kept breaking it.

Perhaps it's just that GitHub Pages isn't handling `{%raw%}{%post_url ...%}{%endraw%}` as
it should? BUT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HANDLE ANYTHING! It's already baked
into Jekyll. ARGH, GITHUB PAGESSS!

The RSS feed was not generated either. Again, something that generated
just fine in my local environment.

### But speaking of RSS, what is it really?

I decided to try something out. And landed upon [NewsBlur](//newsblur.com).

Google knows me too well and suggested open source solutions when all I
searched for was **synced rss feed** -- which in hindsight should've been
rss reader or something.

Back on topic, NewsBlur looks pretty cool. I tried the
[Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newsblur).
It seems slightly clunky in terms of UI. But I feel it would be a pretty
good reading experience.

### As I write this...

in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) right before bed, and think
about how I need to commit and push, and enter passphrases for both...

> I need a neater CMS solution

I remember [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) came with
[NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). I had used that for my **other**
blog. But I don't know if I would use it again.

I am slightly tempted to make my own, but also thinking of trying out
content platforms. I have no idea what they are, I remember
[Fireship once made a video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/c_8cplBi_gE)
and that I started watching and fell asleep, registering none of it.

### Yak shaving

But undoubtedly I am beginning to **shave my yak**, a term I learnt today
[from Twitter](https://twitter.com/synecdotal/status/1491248199109332992?s=20&t=htMoqIhRY1x7EQGq1_Q3EQ)

[a rabbit hole.](https://medium.com/@firehoseproject/a-guide-to-yak-shaving-your-code-d30f98dc759)
or should I say, shaving my yak?

Each of those groups of words is a separate link, but I doubt it's going
to be rendered in any way to indicate so.

I suppose I know what the yak I will shave tomorrow.
